## Light and dark themes to match Fedora system themes

I couldn't find what I was looking for, so here are Two themesets with light and dark versions each to match the look of the Fedora GNOME _Adwaita_ and _Adwaita-dark_ GTK system theme colors to make Visual Studio Code better fit into these Linux systems. 

## Themes

The four contributed themes in this package are:

* `Gnome Light (Atom One)`
* `Gnome Dark (Atom One)`
* `Gnome Light (GitHub)`
* `Gnome Dark (GitHub)`

Syntax highlighting is based on the popular [GitHub Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme) as well as Mahmoud Alis [Atom One Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=akamud.vscode-theme-onelight) and [Atom One Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=akamud.vscode-theme-onedark). All credit for that goes to them.
